# Flow Docs

High-signal docs for the Codex/Claude workflow:

- [`commands/skills.md`](commands/skills.md): `f skills sync`, `f skills reload`, and Codex skill metadata behavior.
- [`commands/commit.md`](commands/commit.md): commit-time testing + skill-gate enforcement.
- [`commands/reviews-todo.md`](commands/reviews-todo.md): fast-commit + deferred Codex deep-review backlog workflow.
- [`fast-commit-deep-review-loop.md`](fast-commit-deep-review-loop.md): recommended speed-first workflow for `~/code/myflow` (GLM/Cerebras fast lane + batched Codex deep reviews).
- [`how-to-use-flow-ai-to-manage-claude-code-sessions.md`](how-to-use-flow-ai-to-manage-claude-code-sessions.md): practical session workflow for Claude + Codex in one repo loop.
- [`use-flow-to-write-software-better.md`](use-flow-to-write-software-better.md): full end-to-end operating model for building software with Flow + Claude/Codex.

- [`flow-toml-spec.md`](flow-toml-spec.md): complete config schema including `[skills.codex]`, `[commit.testing]`, and `[commit.skill_gate]`.
