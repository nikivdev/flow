# Flow Docs

High-signal docs for the Codex/Claude workflow:

- [`commands/ai.md`](commands/ai.md): exact Claude/Codex session behavior (`resume`, TTY requirements, strict-ID semantics).
- [`commands/skills.md`](commands/skills.md): `f skills sync`, `f skills reload`, and Codex skill metadata behavior.
- [`commands/commit.md`](commands/commit.md): commit-time testing + skill-gate enforcement.
- [`commands/invariants.md`](commands/invariants.md): invariant policy checks (`f invariants`) and commit-time enforcement behavior.
- [`commands/reviews-todo.md`](commands/reviews-todo.md): fast-commit + deferred Codex deep-review backlog workflow.
- [`fast-commit-deep-review-loop.md`](fast-commit-deep-review-loop.md): recommended speed-first workflow for `~/code/myflow` (GLM/Cerebras fast lane + batched Codex deep reviews).
- [`how-to-use-flow-ai-to-manage-claude-code-sessions.md`](how-to-use-flow-ai-to-manage-claude-code-sessions.md): practical session workflow for Claude + Codex in one repo loop.
- [`use-flow-to-write-software-better.md`](use-flow-to-write-software-better.md): full end-to-end operating model for building software with Flow + Claude/Codex.
- [`usage-analytics-rollout.md`](usage-analytics-rollout.md): exact patch order for opt-in anonymous usage tracking.
- [`flow-toml-spec.md`](flow-toml-spec.md): complete config schema including `[skills.codex]`, `[commit.testing]`, and `[commit.skill_gate]`.
- [`features.md`](features.md): practical command flows and examples.
- [`moonbit-ai-tasks-implementation.md`](moonbit-ai-tasks-implementation.md): complete inventory of the task-centric MoonBit AI task runtime and Flow-local `.ai/tasks` pack.
- [`ai-task-fast-path-guide.md`](ai-task-fast-path-guide.md): end-to-end setup and tuning guide for lowest-latency AI task execution (`ai-taskd` + `fai`).
- [`moonbit-rust-boundary-refactor-plan.md`](moonbit-rust-boundary-refactor-plan.md): deep scan findings, benchmark gates, and zero-cost MoonBit <> Rust boundary roadmap.
- [`bench/moonbit-rust-ffi-boundary.md`](bench/moonbit-rust-ffi-boundary.md): authoritative microbenchmark for MoonBit <-> Rust FFI overhead, plus tuning guidance.
