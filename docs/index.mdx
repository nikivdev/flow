# Flow Docs

High-signal docs for the Codex/Claude workflow:

- [`commands/ai.md`](commands/ai.md): exact Claude/Codex session behavior (`resume`, TTY requirements, strict-ID semantics).
- [`commands/skills.md`](commands/skills.md): `f skills sync`, `f skills reload`, and Codex skill metadata behavior.
- [`commands/commit.md`](commands/commit.md): commit-time testing + skill-gate enforcement.
- [`commands/invariants.md`](commands/invariants.md): invariant policy checks (`f invariants`) and commit-time enforcement behavior.
