# [flow](https://myflow.sh)

> Everything you need to move your project faster

<!-- todo: curl install, full automate -->

Install this CLI (currently by cloning repo and buliding rust binary).

## Dev 

With flow, run `f setup`, then `f` will search through list of tasks.

Running `f deploy` will compile and put new version of flow into your path (so its easy to make flow work for you). 

For available features, see [docs](docs) or feed `f --help` to AI.

## Examples

All projects of [Nikita](https://github.com/nikivdev) run on flow. Like [rust](https://github.com/nikivdev/rust) & flow itself.
